### Url building
We can use <path>, <int:value> or <float:value> in a URL. <br>
The structure  to acess the app will be:<br>
ip:port defined in app.run()<br>
The default values are 127.0.0.1:5000 but we can change that if needed.

@app.route('/') is the default.<br>
@app.route('/sometag') will create a route to:
ip:port/sometag 

@app.route('/sometag/<int:variable>') will create a route using the value inserted into the function.

@app.route('/sometag/<int:variable>')
def test_route(variable):
    return f'This is the value: {variable}'
    
Same applies to the <float:value>.

### Jinja Templates
- Is a modern designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django templates. 
jinja2 template engine uses following delimiters:
- {% ... %} for statements (if, else, loops, extendings, blocking)
- {{}} for expressions to print to template output
- {# ... #} for comments not included in output
- # ... ## for line statement

### HTTP Methods
- GET -> Send data from the server
- HEAD -> Same as GET without response body
- POST -> Used to send html form data to server
- PUT -> Replace all current representations of the target response with uploaded content
- DELETE -> Removes all current representations of the target resources given by a URL
